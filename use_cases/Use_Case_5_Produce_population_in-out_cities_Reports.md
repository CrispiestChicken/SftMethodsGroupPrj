| **Goal in context**       | As an *Organization worker* I want *to produce a report on population of a continents, regions or countries in the world with data on how many by % live in or outside of cities, organised by largest population to smallest* so that *the organisation has easy access to the relevant information under their pre-requisites*                                                                                                             |
| **Scope**                 | Organisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Preconditions**         | Database contains current population and distribution of people living in cities and those who do not, for all countries aswell as which region and continent each reside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Success End Condition** | The generated report is available and in the correct format chosen by the organisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO** | 1. Organisation requests reports on population in their desired format (in each continent/region/country). <br> 2. system finds the populations within specified conditions and displays them in order of largest population to smallest with all relevant data (name, Total population, population living in cities with % and, population not living in cities with %)  <br> 3. Organisation can read and find relevant information easily |
| **EXTENSIONS**            | 2. in case of no data existing on certain request, the user is informed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
