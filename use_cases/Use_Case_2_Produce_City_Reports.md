| USE CASE 2                | CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Goal in context**       | As an *Organization worker* I want *to produce a report on all the cities in the world organised by largest population to smallest* so that *the organisation has easy access to the relevant information under their pre-requisites*                                                                                                                                          |
| **Scope**                 | Organisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Preconditions**         | Database contains current population for all cities aswell as which district, country, region and continent each reside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Success End Condition** | The generated report is available and in the correct format chosen by the organisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Failed End Condition**  | No report is produced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Primary Actor**         | Other organisation workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Trigger**               | A report on cities is requested in the form of cities in the world or select district/country/region/continent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO** | 1. Organisation requests reports on cities in their desired format (in World/continent/region/country/district). <br> 2. system finds all cities within specified conditions and displays them in order of largest population to smallest with all relevant data (name, country, district and, population)  <br> 3. Organisation can read and find relevant information easily |
| **EXTENSIONS**            | 2. in case of no data existing on certain request, the user is informed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **SUB-VARIATIONS**        | The Organisation may ask for only the top N cities by population (Where N is a number given by database user), in which case only the top N are shown in specified district, country, region, continent or world                                                                                                                                                               |
| **SCHEDULE**              | Due date: Release 1.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
