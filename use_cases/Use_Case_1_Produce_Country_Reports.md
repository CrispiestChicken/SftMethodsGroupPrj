| **Goal in context**       | As an *Organization worker* I want *to produce a report on all the countries in the world organised by largest population to smallest* so that *the organisation has easy access to relevant information under their pre-requisites*                                                                                                                                               |

| **Preconditions**         | Database contains current population for all countries aswell as which region and continent each reside. It must also include each countries capital city                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Trigger**               | A reports on countries is requested in the form of countries in the world or a specified continent/region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO** | 1. Organisation requests a report on countries in there desired format (in World/continent/region). <br> 2. system finds all countries within specified conditions and displays them in order of largest population to smallest with all relevant data (code, name, continent, region, population and capital)  <br> 3. Organisation can read and find relevant information easily |
| **EXTENSIONS**            | 2. in case of no data existing on certain request, the user is informed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **SUB-VARIATIONS**        | The Organisation may ask for only the top N countries by population (Where N is a number given by this systems user), in which case only the top N are shown in the specified region or continent                                                                                                                                                                                  |
